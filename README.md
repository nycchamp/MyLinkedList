# Implementation of a Linked List

## Overview
This is a complete implementation of a doubly Linked list in java. 

## Linked data structures
A data structure is "linked" if it is made up of objects, often called "nodes", that contain references to other nodes. In a linked list, each node contains a reference to the next node in the list. A linked list is used to store a sequence of elements, so each node contains a reference to an element, or sometimes to a collection of elements.
