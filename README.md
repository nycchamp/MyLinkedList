# Implementation of a Linked List

## Overview
This is a complete implementation of a doubly Linked list in java. 
Like an array, a linked list is a simple linear data structure. A linked list is a collection of data elements called *nodes*. In a *singly linked list* each node holds a value and a link to the next node. In a *doubly linked list* each node also holds a link to the previous node.
